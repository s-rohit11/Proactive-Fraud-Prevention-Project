# Proactive Fraud Prevention Project

**Project type:** BSc Honours Dissertation (ongoing)  
**Author:** Rohit Saravanan — BSc Computer Science (Cybersecurity) (Hons)

---

## Overview
This repository supports my undergraduate dissertation on **proactive approaches to credit card fraud prevention**.  
The research focuses on designing and evaluating defensive techniques that detect and discourage fraudulent activity *before* financial loss occurs.

This public repo is a **research showcase** only. Core methods, data, and sensitive implementations are withheld to protect academic integrity and intellectual property.

---

## Research Scope (high-level, non-sensitive)
- Exploring **decoy-based strategies** (e.g. safe honey data) as tripwires for attacker activity.  
- Using **synthetic data generation** for controlled, anonymized transaction testing.  
- Outlining **secure card data protection models** to minimize exposure during fraud attempts.  

*(Note: descriptions here are intentionally broad and exclude sensitive details.)*

## What this repo contains
- `README.md` — overview of the project (public-safe).  
- `docs/` — literature summaries, project roadmap, and safe research notes.  
- `simulation/placeholder_transaction_generator.py` — placeholder for toy dataset demos (to be completed after dissertation guidelines permit).  
- `progress_log.md` — research diary of milestones.  
- `diagrams/` — non-sensitive architecture sketches.

## Project Status
- Literature survey in progress.  
- Repo skeleton created with placeholders for safe public-facing content.  
- Core experiments and implementations maintained in private repositories until dissertation submission.
